# 👋 Hi there, 

I am a research scientist specializing in Sleep Medicine, Exercise Physiology, and Human Performance.

I currently serve as a research scientist in occupational sleep medicine, where I provide guidance on fatigue countermeasures and sleep & circadian science for the aviation industry. I also contribute to a multidisciplinary research project investigating the underlying risk factors of cardiac emergencies and injuries during Ironman triathlons. My mission is to improve the health, performance, and well-being of others by leveraging the skills and expertise I've developed during my 10+ years of clinical experience in Sports Medicine and Human Performance and 8+ years of experience in research and academia. 

## **Aspects of work (research) I particularly enjoy include:** 

1) Data Analysis: Analyzing and interpreting data using a combination of Python, SQL, and Excel to uncover data-driven insights. 
2) Scientific communication (Data storytelling): Translating findings from data analysis, or from a literature review, into clear, meaningful insights through written and verbal communication.

I’m passionate about bridging the gap between theory and real-world application (i.e., translational research)—whether it's through data analysis, scientific communication, or stakeholder education. As such, I am open to opportunities involving scientific communication, health data analytics, or similar roles in translational research—particularly within biotech, digital health, or applied clinical research environments.
