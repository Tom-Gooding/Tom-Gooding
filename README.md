# 👋 Hi there, 

I am a research scientist specializing in Sleep Medicine, Exercise Physiology, and Human Performance with 7+ years of research experience and 10+ years of clinical healthcare experience in sports medicine and human performance.

Whether its through data analysis, scientific writing, or stakeholder education, I enjoy translating complex research into actionable, user-friendly insights that can be used to improve health, performance, and well-being.

I am open to roles involving research/education, medical/scientific writing, or data analytics—particularly in biomedical, biotech, digital health, and applied clinical research environments where I can leverage my background and subject matter expertise.

Thank you for stopping by and I look forward to connecting!

Tom
