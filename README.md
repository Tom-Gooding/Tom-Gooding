# 👋 Hi there, 

I am a research scientist specializing in Sleep Medicine, Exercise Physiology, and Human Performance.

I currently serve as a research scientist in occupational sleep medicine, where I provide guidance on fatigue countermeasures and sleep & circadian science for the aviation industry. I also contribute to a multidisciplinary research project investigating the underlying risk factors of cardiac emergencies and injuries during Ironman triathlons. My mission is to improve the health, performance, and well-being of others by leveraging the skills and expertise I've developed during my 7+ years of experience in research/academia and my 10+ years of experience in as an allied healthcare professional in Sports Medicine/Human Performance. 

I’m passionate about bridging the gap between theory and real-world application (i.e., translational research)—whether it's through data analysis, scientific communication, or stakeholder education. As such, I am open to opportunities involving scientific communication, biomedical/healthcare data analytics, or similar roles in translational research—particularly within biotech, digital health, or applied clinical research settings.
